This repository contains a Flask based application that uses SQLalchemy, as well as Plotly and D3 to create interactive visualizations of scientific data about bacteria cultures taken from people's belly button. This data originated at the Rob Dunn Lab (more info here: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) .
