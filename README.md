This repository contains a Flask based application that uses SQLalchemy, as well as Plotly and D3 to create interactive visualizations of scientific data. 
The data is of bacteria cultures taken from people's belly buttons. This data originated at the Rob Dunn Lab (more info here: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) .
